# Dinners Ready

We built a mobile app which recommended food recipes. The main goal of the project was learning about SCRUM and DevOps.
For that reason we built a [basic CI pipeline](https://github.com/Daniel14gonc/DinnersReady-Api/blob/master/.github/workflows/github-actions-ec2.yml) with GitHub Actions.
